- [ ] None of your GUI code was generated by an AI algorithm like GPT
- [ ] If not tkinter - looked for Demo Programs for specific port
- [ ] For non tkinter - Looked at readme for your specific port if not PySimpleGUI (Qt, WX, Remi)
- [ ] Run your program outside of your debugger (from a command line)
- [ ] Searched through Issues (open and closed) to see if already reported Issues.PySimpleGUI.org
- [ ] Have upgraded to the latest release of PySimpleGUI on PyPI (lastest official version)
